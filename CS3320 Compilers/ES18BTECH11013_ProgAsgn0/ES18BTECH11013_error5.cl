 * A 'zero width' space character is included in the "Hello,  World!!\n" string, which cool doesnt recognize.
 * Section 10.5, 1st sentence states : "White space consists of any sequence of the characters: blank (ascii 32), \n (newline, ascii 10),
  \f (form feed, ascii 12), \r (carriage return, ascii 13), \t (tab, ascii 9), \v (vertical tab, ascii 11)."
